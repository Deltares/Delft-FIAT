title: Types of hazard maps
---
::: {.callout-tip}
The most advised format for both event and risk is netCDF.
:::

## Event
Event maps are generally supplied in singular fashion (i.e. one band per event map).
This band just simply contains the hazard values per cell. Let's have a quick peek at the data using [gdalinfo](https://gdal.org/programs/gdalinfo.html):

:::: {.columns}
::: {style="height: 400px; overflow: auto;"}
```{python}
#| echo: false
!gdalinfo ../../../.testdata/hazard/event_map.nc
```
:::
::::
::: {.callout-note}
Allthough netCDF is the preferred format, GeoTIFF's are also very handy for single events.
:::

As one can see, this dataset has only one band (variable).

When created, it is preferred that the event map is compressed to prevent unneccessary data on the hard drive.
More information regarding the compression and others settings can be found [here](https://gdal.org/drivers/raster/netcdf.html#creation-options).

## Risk
Risk maps in gerenal should contain multiple bands.

These bands can be either supplied in either one of two ways:

- Multiple variables (like normal bands)
- As a subdataset

Lets take a look quick look at the data (again with `gdalinfo`):

:::: {.columns}
::: {style="height: 400px; overflow: auto;"}
```{python}
#| echo: false
!gdalinfo ../../../.testdata/hazard/risk_map.nc
```
:::
::::
::: {.callout-note}
Instead of seeing normal metadata, we only get an overview of the available subdatasets.
:::

Multiple netCDF variables are normally not recognized as bands by the [netCDF driver](https://gdal.org/drivers/raster/netcdf.html) of GDAL.
Instead they are interpreted as subdatasets (!). One can set the key `var_as_band` to `true` within the [settings file](../settings/index.qmd)
to read the subdatasets as bands.

```toml
[hazard]
file = <your-file>
risk = true
[hazard.settings]
var_as_band = true
```

When supplied in one subdataset (all bands are within that subdataset),
the `subset` variable within the [settings file](../settings/index.qmd) should be set under the header `hazard.settings`.
The value set to `subset` should be the name of the desired subdataset.

```toml
[hazard]
file = <your-file>
risk = true
[hazard.settings]
var_as_band = false
subset = <your-wanted-subdataset>
```
