The model settings are configured in a *settings.toml* file. The configuration file consists of important core information and can be extended with a range of optional input. The following structure shows all information, some mandatory other optional, that can be included in the settings:

> *Note: File paths in the settings can be relative to the settings.toml file or absolute.*
