title: "Settings file"
---
The model settings are configured in a *settings.toml* file. The configuration file consists of some basic information and can be extended with a range of optional data input. The following structure shows all information, some mandatory other optional, that can be included in the settings:

> *Note: File paths in the settings can be relative to the settings.toml file or absolute.*

***Full settings.toml** (required & optional fields):* 
```
[global]
crs = "EPSG:4326" [OPTIONAL] # Projection for FIAT to work with
gdal_cache = 10 #MB [OPTIONAL] # Set the GDAL cache in megabytes to restrict the footprint of GDAL
keep_temp_files = false [OPTIONAL] # true or false whether to keep temporary files generated during calculation
thread = 4 [OPTIONAL] # Set the number of threads of the calculations

[global.grid]
chunk = [1024, 1014] [OPTIONAL] # Set grid chunk size

[output] 
path = "output" [REQUIRED] # Set directory path to save the output 

[output.csv]
name = "output.csv" [REQUIRED] # File name of the output csv

[output.geom]
name1 = "spatial.gpkg" [REQUIRED] # File name of the output vector data

[output.grid]
name = "output.nc" [REQUIRED] # File name for the output for the grid model; WARN: not fully implemented yet

[hazard]
file = 'hazard/event_map.nc' [REQUIRED]  # Path to hazard file (raster or netCDF). Can contain one (for events) or multiple (for return periods) bands
crs = 'EPSG:32617' [REQUIRED if crs is unknown in dataset] # Projection for FIAT to work with
elevation_reference = 'dem' [REQUIRED] # DEM or Datum for a water depth or water elevation map
risk = true  [REQUIRED] # true or false, if true, risk (EAD) is calculated
return_periods = [2, 5, 10, 25] [OPTIONAL] # return periods for hazard calculation when they cannot be inferred from the data itself

[hazard.settings]
chunk = [1024, 1014] [OPTIONAL] # Set chunk size (Advise to use the setting under global.grid)
subset = 'zs' [OPTIONAL] # Specific layer from a multilayered netCDF file (GDAL can't read those properly)
var_as_band = false [OPTIONAL] # true or false # Read netCDF subdatasets as raster bands

[exposure.csv]
file = 'exposure/exposure.csv'  [REQUIRED]# All additional info for the vector data
index = "Object ID" [OPTIONAL] specify the index column of the data

[exposure.geom]
crs = 'EPSG:32617' # [REQUIRED IF CRS IS UNKNOWN IN DATA]
file1 = 'exposure/buildings.gpkg' [REQUIRED] # file path of exposure vector file with Object ID column to enable linking exposure.csv output to vector file. 

[exposure.grid] 
crs = 'EPSG:32617' [REQUIRED, if netCDF grid provided as hazard file] # Output projection
file = 'exposure/raster.nc' [REQUIRED, if netCDF grid provided as hazard file] ###All grid stuff check again!!!!

[exposure.grid.settings]
chunk = [1024, 1014] [OPTIONAL] # Set the size at which to chunk (Advise to use the setting under global.grid)
var_as_band = true [OPTIONAL] # true or false # Read netCDF subdatasets as raster bands

[vulnerability]
file = 'vulnerability/vulnerability_curves.csv' [REQUIRED] # Damage functions for impact assessment
step_size = 0.01 [OPTIONAL] # Interpolation scale for the vulnerability curves
```
Please find a simplified example of the *settings.toml* below soley made up of the required and little optional data input: 

***Mini settings.toml** (soley required fields):* 
```
[global]

[vulnerability]
