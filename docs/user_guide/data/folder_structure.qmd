## Delft-FIAT Folder Dependencies
---
title: "Folder structure"

---

FIAT computes the damage of a flood event at a specified geographic location based on three main data inputs;

  - Hazard data
  - Exposure data
  - Vulnerability data

It is recommended to set up folder dependency set up as shown below to ensure that FIAT can find each data file and run smoothly.

```

├───📁 FIAT/
    ├───📁 exposure/
    │   ├───📄 buildings.gpkg
    │   └───📄 exposure.csv
    ├───📁 hazard/
    │   └───📄 hazard_map.geotiff
    ├───📁 vulnerability/
    │   └───📄 damage_curves.csv
    └───📄 settings.toml

```
