title: "Exposure data"
---

The **exposure data** describe the assets within the region of interest. FIAT allows **vector and raster data** inputs. It is recommended to place the exposure data in the 'exposure' folder, see the [FIAT folder structure page](folder_structure.qmd). However, the file name is free to be chosen by the user and must simply be refered to in the [settings.toml](settings.qmd) configuration file.

::: {.callout-tip}
You can also create your exposure data with the [**HydroMT-FIAT  model builder**](https://deltares.github.io/hydromt_fiat/latest/#)
:::


## Geometry data
FIAT can be used to assess flood damages to buildings, roads, utilities, and other types of structures of which data is available. These type of assets are often spatially represented with vector, or geometry data. Building a FIAT model with geometry exposure data requires two data types:

1. A or multiple **geometry files** (see acceptable file types at the bottom of this page) with an attribute `Object ID` that holds unique IDs over all geometry files
2. One **CSV file** containing a column `Object ID` linking to the geometries in the geometry file(s) and exposure information like maximum potential damages

Along with the *exposure.csv* - file it is advisable to render one or more vector files of the exposed objects (e.g. points, building footprints) with an index column, carrying the same name as the index column of the *exposure.csv* to allow for merging of the exposure files (optional). The name of the vector file should be descriptive of the objects it represents (e.g. 'buildings.gpkg','road.gpkg') and must be specified in the *settings.toml* configuration file. The advantage of providing these extra vector files is that (1) water levels or depths can be considered over the entire object (when 'extraction method' = 'area'); this can be more appropriate than point estimates for large buildings.(2) FIAT offers the **FIAT Toolbox** application to post-process the model results and improves visualization and interpretation of the results in GIS software applications.


### Geometry file
A user can specify one or multiple **geometry files** in the [settings.toml](settings.qmd). Most-used file types are GeoPackages or Shapefiles but more file types are accepted as can be seen at the bottom of this page. All geometry files must have an attribute `Object ID` that holds unique IDs over all geometry files. For example, when using a GeoPackage file with roads containing `Object IDs` 1-100, a second GeoPackage file with building footprints should contain `Object IDs` from 101-n.

::: {.callout-warning}
Assets cannot be outside the area of the hazard map input! Assets that fully fall out of the hazard extend are automatically removed by FIAT. BUT any asset that partially falls outside the flood map extent must be removed manually by the user.
:::

### CSV
The exposure data CSV file contains information about each object in the area of interest that is needed for the damage calculation. Each row represents an object, such as a building, road segment, or utility, and each column represents an attribute of the object, such as its location, elevation or maximum potential damage value.
For users who would want to create their own exposure data, or modify existing exposure data, a description of the default fields (columns) in the exposure data CSV can be found in @tbl-exposure.

A more detailed description of the data fields in the *exposure.csv* can be found below;

 **Object ID/Object name**
 Object ID and Object name are administrative information, which the user is free to choose. Input must be unique for each object, if they are not unique, FIAT gives a warning and stops the model built-up.

**Primary/Secondary object type**
The primary object type describes the category of the asset (e.g. residential or commercial). The secondary object type allows for a more detailed profile of the object (e.g. single-story home, or grocery store). The developer of the exposure dataset is free to set their own categories of object types. (*Exception: FIAT requires **roads** to be assigned as **primary object type = ‘road**’, to summarize road damages separately from buildings and utilities*.)

::: {.callout-note}
 Defining primary/secondary object types facilitates the assignment of damage functions to the objects for the user by creating automatic look-up tables.
:::

**Extraction Method**
The extraction method refers to which water level or water depth is selected over an object. The options are (1) centroid, which selects the water level or depth at the center of the object, or (2) area, which considers the water level or depth over the entire polygon and takes either an average or maximum; this latter choice is selected in the setting file.

::: {.callout-important}
 In case the user selects 'area' as extraction method, the user must provide an Object-Location vector file, which contains the areal polygons of the objects.
:::

**Damage Functions**

There are three damage function fields: structure, content, and other. At least one of these must be provided for each object. The value that is entered is the name of the damage function. This name is coupled to the damage function CSV file via the setting file. The field **'Damage function: other'** can refer to various object types (e.g. the inventory of a restaurant). The user is free to use any damage function for this field. Damage functions can be obtained from [European Commission's Joint Research Centre](https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC105688), but it is recommended to use more location-specific functions when available.

**Ground Floor Height**
The ground floor height gives the distance of the finished floor of an asset above ground level. E.g. a building is raised by 1 foot above the ground, the ground floor height is equal to 1 foot.

**Ground Elevation**
The ground elevation is the value of a digital elevation model (DEM) at the location of the object.

**Maximum Potential Damage**
The maximum potential damage correspond to the damage functions for each asset. For each damage function type that was assigned, a maximum potential damage must also be assigned. These values represent the maximum damage to the structure, content, or other (e.g. inventory). There are methods to derive these values, based on building type and area of the building. Global maximum damage values can be obtained from  [European Commission's Joint Research Centre](https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC105688), but it is recommended to use more location-specific damage values. In the US, [FEMA Hazus](https://www.fema.gov/flood-maps/products-tools/hazusis) is an industry standard in how to derive these values.

**Aggregation Label**
These columns can be used by **FIAT Toolbox** to aggregate over any aggregation label that the user specifies. These aggregation labels can include for example: land use, census tract, and census block.
The user can add columns to the csv file manually or with the help of the [**HydroMT-FIAT  model builder**](https://deltares.github.io/hydromt_fiat/latest/#), in which the user is free to select a descriptive 'Label name' for the additional attributes.
If the user wishesto cenneted these aggregated results to a vector file, **FIAT Toolbox** offers a post-processing tool to do so.


## Raster Data
Raster files must be **pre-processed** before being ingested into the FIAT model. Raster projection and extent must be coherent among exposure rasters and hazard maps. For each object type (e.g. residential buildings, industrial assets) a raster file with the **Max Potential Damage** per cell is required. A damage function must be assigned to each raster file as well.
