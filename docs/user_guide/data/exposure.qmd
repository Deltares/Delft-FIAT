title: "Exposure data"
---

The exposure data serves to describe the assets within the affected region that the user intends to assess. This data file should be made available in either CSV or netCDF format and must be located in the 'exposure' folder, following the prescribed naming convention, which includes 'exposure.csv' or 'exposure.nc. It is recommended to render an additional vector file of the exposed objects (e.g. points, building footbprints) with an index column, carrying the same name as the index column of the exposure.csv to allow for merging of the exposure files (optional). The name of the vector file should be descriptive of the objects it represents (e.g. 'buildings.gpkg','road.gpkg') and must be specified in the *settings.toml* configuration file. The advantage of providing this extra file is that FIAT offers the **FIAT Toolbox** application to post-process the model results and visualize them in GIS software applications. 

The exposure data CSV file contains information about each object in the area of interest that is needed for the damage calculation. Each row represents an object, such as a building, road segment, or utility, and each column represents an attribute of the object, such as its location, elevation or maximum potential damage value. 
For users who would want to create their own exposure data, or modify existing exposure data, Table 1 provides a description of the default fields (columns) in the exposure data CSV.
