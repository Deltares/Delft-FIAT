title: Geometry
---
A user can specify one or multiple **geometry files** in the [settings.toml](../settings.qmd). It is advisable to give descriptive names to the geometry files, e.g., *buildings.gpkg* or *roads.gpkg*. Most-used file types are GeoPackages or Shapefiles but more file types are accepted as can be seen at the bottom of this page. All geometry files must have an attribute `Object ID` that holds unique IDs over all geometry files, linking to the `Object ID` column in the exposure CSV file (see below).

::: {.callout-tip title="Example"}
When using a GeoPackage file with roads containing `Object IDs` 1-100, a second GeoPackage file with building footprints should contain `Object ID`s from 101-n. Then, those IDs should link to the corresponding rows and IDs in the exposure CSV file.
:::

When providing a polygon or line geometry file, a user can choose to use the *area extraction method* ('extraction method' = 'area', see [here](csv.qmd#tbl-exposure)) for considering water levels or depths over the whole area of the asset. This can be more appropriate than point estimates for example for large buildings.

::: {.callout-warning}
Assets cannot be partially or fully outside the hazard map extent! FIAT will stop if it detects any.
