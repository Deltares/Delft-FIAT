title: CSV

The exposure data CSV file contains information about each asset in the area of interest that is optional for the damage calculation. Each row represents one asset, such as a building, road segment, or utility, and each column represents an attribute of the asset, such as its location, elevation or maximum potential damage value.
For users that want to create their own exposure data, or modify existing exposure data, a description of the default fields (columns) in the exposure data CSV can be found [here](./data.qmd).

Users can add as many columns to the exposure CSV as they want, for example, to later identify the most damaged administrative areas. All data field will also be saved in the output of FIAT.
