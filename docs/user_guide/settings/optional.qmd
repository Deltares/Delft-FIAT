title: "Optional input"

If the user prefers to have more control over their model run or to utilize grid data instead of vector data, FIAT offers the flexibility to customize settings for each variable (@tbl-toml). Advanced FIAT users can find more options in the [advanced options page](../advanced.qmd).

`crs`: The projection of the hazard file. If no global projection is defined, the output will be in the same projection as the hazard map.
