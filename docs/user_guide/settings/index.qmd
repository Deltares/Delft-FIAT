title: "Settings"
---
The user must set the model settings in the `settings.toml` configuration file.

Besides the necessary/ required setttings one can set:

- input in regard to the computational side of FIAT (e.g. chunking, number of threads etc),
    - see this [page](computation.qmd)
- optional/ additional input that is not necessary or more data specific,
    - see this [page](optional.qmd)

### Basic input
This section pertains to all input that is vital for running a FIAT model.

These inputs/ entries are listed in the table down below with more detailed information per entry underneath the table.

::: {.callout-note}
File paths in the settings can be relative to the settings.toml file or absolute.

: Most basic settings file input {#tbl-toml .hover}

#### [model]

- `model_type`: The type of model. Choice between 'geom' and 'grid'.

#### [output]

- `path`:  The path to the output folder in the working directory.

#### [output.csv]

- `name[n]`: The path to the output CSV file(s) that will be created. These are linked to the input geometry files.

#### [output.geom]

- `name[n]`: This sets the name and location of the output vector file that contains the geometry, location and the damages per asset.

::: {.callout-warning}
If provided, the suffix is mandatory. The suffix should match the suffix of the input geometry file for which it is set.
:::

#### [output.grid]

- `name`: This sets the name and location of the output raster file that contains damages per grid cell.

#### [hazard]

- `file`: The file path to the hazard file.

- `elevation_reference`: This indicates the elevation reference of the flood map. In case of a flood-depth map this should be "DEM" while in case of a flood-elevation map this should be "datum".

#### [exposure.csv]

- `file`: The path to the exposure CSV file (recommended to be within the [exposure folder](../data/index.qmd)) that contains the [required information](../data/exposure.qmd) per asset. There can only be one exposure CSV file.

#### [exposure.geom]

- `file[n]`: The path to the exposure vector file (recommended to be within the [exposure folder](../data/index.qmd)) with the assets' geometry and object_id. The user can provide multiple vector files. Therefore the '[n]' suffix, as the user can create mulitple entries for vector files (e.g. `file1`, `file2` etc.).

::: {.callout-warning}
The suffix is mandatory. So if only one file is provided, name it `file1`.
:::
::: {.callout-note}
Only required when running the geometry based model.
:::

#### [exposure.grid]

- `file`: The path to the exposure raster file (recommended to be within the [exposure folder](../data/index.qmd)).

::: {.callout-note}
Only required when running the raster based model.
:::

#### [vulnerability]

- `file`: The path to the vulnerability curves CSV file within the [vulnerability folder](../data/index.qmd) that contains the [damage curves](../data/vulnerability.qmd). Only one vulnerability curves file is allowed.

### Example

An example of settings file for running a geometry model is given below:

```toml
[output]
path = "output"

[output.csv]
name = "output.csv"

[output.geom]
name1 = "spatial.gpkg"

[hazard]
file = "hazard/SL_10yr_reprojected.tif"
elevation_reference = "DEM"
risk = false

[exposure.geom]
file1 = "./exposure/buildings.gpkg"

[exposure.csv]
file = "./exposure/exposure.csv"

[vulnerability]
file = "./vulnerability/vulnerability_curves.csv"
```
