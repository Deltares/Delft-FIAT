- Command line user interface
- Main `FIAT` object from which it's run
- `GeomModel`; the vector based model
- `GridModel`; the raster based model
- `ConfigReader`; for reading the settings file
- I/O methods and structs
    - `open_csv` which returns e.g. `Table`
    - `open_geom` which returns a `GeomSource`
    - `open_grid` which returns a `GridSource`
- GIS related operations like:
    - `geom.reproject` to reproject vector files
    - `grid.reproject` to reproject raster files
    - `overlay.clip` to clip a grid based on a polygon
    - and more...
- Some smalller miscellaneous methods and object
    - In the [API reference](api/index.qmd)

### Foreseen future fixes
