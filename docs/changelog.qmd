## Unreleased
This contains the unreleased changes to Delft-FIAT.

### Added
- Function (`generate_jobs`) to generate jobs for parallelization
- Function (`execute_pool`) to execute code in parallel using `multiprocessing`
- General method of creating output files in `GeomModel` (`_setup_output_files`)
- Method `_create_model_dirs` of `ConfigReader` object for creating result directories in one go
- Method `set` of `ConfigReader` object
- Method `size` of `GeomSource` object for in situ size return; `count` becomes private
- Method `size` of `GridSource` object for in situ size return; `count` becomes private
- Setting return period as a variable in hazard map bands (risk)

### Changed
- Made read methods of `BaseModel`, `GeomModel` and `GridModel` public (removed underscore)
- Parallelization now depends solely on `multiprocessing` instead of on `concurrent.futures`
- Testing of workers (not properly caught due to using `multiprocessing`)
- Testing only based on integers

### Deprecated
- Methods `_create_output_dir`, `_create_tmp_dir` and `_create_risk_dir` of the `ConfigReader` object
- Setting return period via the name of the hazard band (risk)
- Support of `Python` versions under `3.9.0`

### Documentation

## v0.1.0rc2 (2024-02-19)
The second pre-release of Delft-FIAT.

### Added
- A version switcher for the documentation
- Added entries for chunking size in the settings file (`settings.toml`) for `GeomModel`
- Chunking for geometry calculations (`GeomModel`)
- Chunking for resolving temporary `GeomModel` output
- New method for writing geometries from a buffer: `BufferedGeomWriter`
- New function for merging vector layers: `merge_geom_layers`
- Setting of amount of threads via cli

### Changed
- Better build environment creation on linux systems
- Clarified the cli
- Fixed chunking on a single thread
- Fixed and clarified the shape (w, h) of `GridSource` and `Grid`
- Fixed handling of positive nodata values in geometry calculations
- Fixed indexing in `GridModel` calculations
- Parallelisation of calculations for `GeomModel` (not only in risk mode)
- Updated the installer creation (exe) on Windows (10/11)
- Various bug fixes

### Deprecated
- `get_bbox` method of `GeomSource` and `GridSource`
- Setting: `chunk` in `exposure.geom.settings`, deprecated in favour of `chunk` in `global.geom`
- Setting: `chunk` in `exposure.grid.settings`, deprecated in favour of `chunk` in `global.grid`
- Setting: `chunk` in `hazard.settings`, deprecated in favour of `chunk` in `global.grid`

### Documentation
- Ability to switch between documentation/ software versions
- Improved/ updated the page regarding exposure csv
- Restructered user settings pages
- Seperated user settings into: Basic, Computational & Optional

## v0.1.0rc1 (2023-11-30)
This is the first and pre-release of Delft-FIAT. It aims to have a stable version of the `GeomModel` for calculating damages and risk for vector exposure data and an experimental version of the `GridModel` for calculating damages and risk for raster exposure data.

### Added
- Documentation
- Command line user interface
- Main `FIAT` object from which it's run
- `GeomModel`; the vector based model
- `GridModel`; the raster based model
- `ConfigReader`; for reading the settings file
- I/O methods and structs
    - `open_csv` which returns e.g. `Table`
    - `open_geom` which returns a `GeomSource`
    - `open_grid` which returns a `GridSource`
- GIS related operations like:
    - `geom.reproject` to reproject vector files
    - `grid.reproject` to reproject raster files
    - `overlay.clip` to clip a grid based on a polygon
    - and more...
- Ability to 'compile'/ freeze FIAT as an application/ binary
    - Windows
    - Linux (tested on [Debian](https://www.debian.org/)/ [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/))
- Some smalller miscellaneous methods and object
    - In the [API reference](api/index.qmd)
