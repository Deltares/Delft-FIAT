title: Setup Docker
---

A docker file is present within the repository of Delft-FIAT. This docker file can
be found [here](https://github.com/Deltares/Delft-FIAT/blob/master/Dockerfile).

From this docker file a docker image can be produced. In the creation process of the
docker image, pixi is used. [Pixi](https://pixi.sh/latest/) is a fast(er) alternative of creating and
installing python environments compared to mamba (conda). Creating a docker image can
be done with the following command:

::: {.callout-note}
Note: Set the current directory to the directory of the cloned repository.
:::

```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile --build-arg="PIXIENV=default" -t fiat .
```

However, as an alternative, it can be build directly from the docker file in the github
remote repository:

```bash
docker build -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Deltares/Delft-FIAT/master/Dockerfile --build-arg="PIXIENV=default" -t fiat .
```

::: {.callout-note}
The build argument `PIXIENV` is used to define which python enviroment to use. Using the `default` environment is recommended.
An overview of all the environments can be found in the [pixi toml file](https://github.com/Deltares/Delft-FIAT/blob/master/pixi.toml).
