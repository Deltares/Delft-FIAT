title: "Setup Miniforge3"
---

In order to develop on **FIAT** locally, the Python package manager **Miniforge3** is recommended.

Download and install [Miniforge3](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge)

Make sure the conda binary (and mamba) is added to PATH. In windows this is simply done via the 'set environment variables' screen, on linux one can append the 'PATH' variable via the `.bashrc` configurations file (or another rc file corresponding with the shell in use).
Initialize conda by running the following command in your shell.

```bash
conda init
```

Depending on your computer settings, you might also have to run the following in a Powershell terminal as administrator:

```bash
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```
