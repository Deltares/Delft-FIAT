title: "Installing FIAT"
---

## For Use
FIAT can be installled in an existing environment or the user can create a new environment. We recommened to create a new environment to avoid issues with other dependencies and packages.

### New environment
To create a new environment follow the steps below.

- Create a new environment:

```bash
conda create -n fiat python=3.12.*
```
- Activate the environment:

```bash
conda activate fiat`
```

- Install FIAT from [pypi]():

```bash
pip install delft_fiat
```

- Install FIAT from [conda-forge]()

```bash
# When conda-forge is added as a channel
conda install delft_fiat

# When not
conda install delft_fiat -c conda-forge
```

- Install FIAT from Github. After creating the new environment, you need to install all dependencies from the Deltares Github repository. You can use **pip install** to do so:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Deltares/Delft-FIAT.git
```

### Existing environment
If you want to install FIAT into an existing environment, simply activate the desired environment and run:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Deltares/Delft-FIAT.git
```
