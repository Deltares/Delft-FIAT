title: "Development install"
---

This is for those who wish to contribute to the development of FIAT.

- First, clone the FIAT repository on Github into a local directory of choice:

```bash
cd ~/{your path}

git clone https://github.com/Deltares/Delft-FIAT.git fiat
```

- Create a new development environment. Make sure you either have tomli or tomllib (build-in with Python 3.11) in your base enviroment. Go into your cloned FIAT repository folder and create the environment file by running the *make_env.py* script:

```bash
cd ~/{your path}/fiat

python make_env.py dev
```

- Then, create and activate the new environment in conda:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml

conda activate fiat_dev
```

- To install all the required dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

There you go. FIAT is now installed on your local machine for development purposes.
