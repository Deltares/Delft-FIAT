title: "Freeze FIAT as an application"
---

To freeze FIAT as an application/executable, it is required to have the FIAT repository cloned on your local machine. A different environment is needed to build the application:

- Create a yml for a seperate **build** environment:

    `python make_env.py build`

- Create the environment with mamba. This time, FIAT will be automatically installed with the environment:

    `mamba env create -f environment.yml`

- Go to the .build/core directory and execute the pybuild.bat script:

    `cd ./.build`

    `win64.bat`

That's it.
A FIAT application will be located in the `{root}/bin/Release` folder.
