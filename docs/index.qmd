## Getting to Know Delft-FIAT

[**Delft-FIAT**](https://www.deltares.nl/en/software-and-data/products/delft-fiat-flood-impact-assessment-tool) is a free, python-based **Fast Impact Assessment Tool**, designed and continuously improved by Deltares. It is configured to run quick, consistent, and well-founded **flood damage** and **risk calculations** on the basis of flood maps and additional inputs such as depth-damage functions, asset locations, and their maximum potential damages. Delft-FIAT allows rapid assessment of the direct **economic** and **monetary impacts** to buildings, utilities, and roads for specified flood events and return periods. Fast impact modeling removes bottlenecks in **climate adaptation planning**, allowing for large numbers of calculations needed to understand the effectiveness of adaptation strategies and the changes in damage and risk as climate and socio-economic conditions change. In the further documentation, Delft-FIAT will be refered to simply as **FIAT**.

**FIAT** works with an easy format for exposed assets, consisting of information on the location, exposed value, ground floor height, and associated depth-damage function, which can be modified by the user. A simple configuration file specifies the location of depth-damage functions and flood maps, as well as return periods of flood maps if calculating risk (@fig-FIAT).

Thanks to its flexible character, FIAT **integrates** with various software applications such as flood adaptation planning tool [**FloodAdapt**](https://www.deltares.nl/en/software-and-data/products/floodadapt) or an [interTwin digital twin](https://www.intertwin.eu/intertwin-use-case-deploying-floodadapt-a-digital-twin-for-flood-impact-modelling-anywhere-on-earth/) and can be called multiple times to e.g. assess uncertainty in damage estimates, or run for numerous flood scenarios.
