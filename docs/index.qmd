## Getting to Know Delft-FIAT

**Delft-FIAT**  is a free, pyhton-based **Fast Impact Assessment Tool**, designed and continuously improved by Deltares. It is configured to run quick, consistent, and well-founded **flood damage** and **risk calculations** on the basis of flood maps, and additional inputs such as depth-damage functions, asset locations and their maximum potential damages. Delft-FIAT allows rapid assessment of the direct **economic** and **monetary impacts** to buildings, utilities, and roads for input for specified flood events and return periods. Fast impact modeling removes bottlenecks in **climate adaptation planning**, allowing for the large numbers of calculations needed to understand the effectiveness of adaptation strategies and the changes in damage and risk as climate and socio-economic conditions change. In the further documentation Delft-FIAT will be refered to simply **FIAT**.

**FIAT** works with an easy format for exposed assets, consisting of information on the location, exposed value, ground floor height, and associated depth-damage function, which can be modified by the user. A simple configuration file specifies the location of depth-damage functions and flood maps, as well as return periods of flood maps if calculating risk (@fig-FIAT).

Thanks to its flexible character, FIAT **integrates** with various software applications such as flood modeling or GIS software and can be called multiple times to e.g. assess uncertainty in damage estimates, or run for numerous flood scenarios.
